# Cryptography-TraditionalCiphersImplementation


Cryptography is used to secure and protect data during communication. 
Encryption is a process which transforms the original information into an unrecognizable form.
Decryption is a process of converting encoded/encrypted data in a form that is readable and understood by a human or a computer.
A cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.
Ciphers are of two types: i)Traditional ii)Modern
In this project, we mainly focused on the implementation of traditional ciphers: 
 
CEASER CIPHER: Ceaser cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter in a text is replaced by 
replacing units of plain text are replaced with cipher text, according to a fixed number.
COLUMNAR CIPHER: Columnar cipher is a transposition cipher in which text is divided into a matrix form and then it’s transpose is found out and basing on that, the encrypted text is generated.
This application can be used to easily encrypt and decrypt message by providing the message to be encrypted and the message to be decrypted, key respectively. The user can be able to encrypt any number of messages and decrypt any number of messages. As long as the user wants to perform any action, we continue to take input and perform the action. 

It provides menu driven, user-friendly interface to the user. So that the user will be able to use it easily.  It provides the option if the user wants to perform any action. Basing on that, we provide the options to encrypt/decrypt the message.
